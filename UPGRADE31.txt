If you are upgrading from Siteframe 3.0 to 3.1, you will need to
import the new and modified templates. These are provided in the
file

    templates/templates.xml

To import them, go to the Control Panel, then select "Import
theme/template XML file." When prompted, browse for this file on
your local system.

NOTE: this actually includes all standard Siteframe templates.
Only templates which differ from your existing templates are
imported, and your existing templates will be renamed with a .BAK
extension.

DO NOT change the theme name, or else the templates will not
function.

Press Submit to import the templates.

If you have made any changes to these content templates, you should
manually evaluate the new templates and decide whether to edit the
templates or to simply use the new ones.
