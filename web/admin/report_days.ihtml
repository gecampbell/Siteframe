<p>This report is based on the number of unique <i>sessions</i> that have been recorded. A <i>session</i> is a single visit during the time that the user's browser has been open. If the user closes his or her browser and re-opens it, that counts as two or more sessions. If the user visits multiple pages in one session, that still only counts as a single session.</p>
