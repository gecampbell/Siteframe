======================================================================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
======================================================================
See http://siteframe.org for the complete list of required software.

Apache - the system was developed and tested on Apache 1.3.19. In
fact, Siteframe will probably work on any system that supports PHP
and MySQL, but no testing has been done outside this platform. Users
have reported success in using Siteframe on a Windows 2000 platform
with Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), but this has not
been verified. Siteframe works quite happily with Apache 2.0.

PHP version 4.2 - Siteframe uses features of PHP 4.0.6 that do
not appear in earlier versions of PHP. PHP must be compiled with
the "GD 2.0" option if you wish to use graphics.

MySQL 3.23.53 - it may work (and probably will work) with earlier
versions of MySQL, but it has not been tested. The earliest known
release of MySQL to work with Siteframe is 3.23.32.

Siteframe has been validated against MySQL 4.0, and there is evidence
of vastly improved performance when MySQL's query caching is enabled.

Siteframe has not been thoroughly tested with MySQL 4.1, and its
use is not currently recommended or supported.

======================================================================
INSTALLATION
======================================================================

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.2.2 - November 6, 2005
======================================================================

Release 3.2 makes a number of changes to table column names to ensure
that all data is available; please read UPGRADE32.txt - you will need
to run a SQL script to update your database.

This release includes two fixes for security issues that left Siteframe
sites vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It is strongly
recommended that all users install this version.

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.1.5 - March 16, 2004
======================================================================

Corrected a problem caused when a user was deleted; folders owned
by the user were also deleted (correctly), however, documents owned
by other users in shared folders owned by the deleted user were not
deleted as well.

Corrected a problem where document tags would not work when the web
server had enable_globals turned off (the ?tag= was not correctly
passed to the document.php script).

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.1.3 - September 20, 2003
======================================================================

Added "PROOF" function; when selected, adds the word "PROOF" across
all images larger than 150 pixels.

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.1.2 - September 20, 2003
======================================================================

Modifications to siteframe.sql so that the database will build
properly under MySQL 4.1. MySQL 4.1 provides a much more sophisticated
search interface than in previous versions; however, the SQL syntax
has some incompatibilities.

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.1.1 - July 4, 2003
======================================================================

Added new script rotate.php that rotates an image in 90 degree
increments. Modified comment template to invoke it.

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.1 - June 28, 2003
======================================================================

NOTE: please read the file UPGRADE31.txt if you are upgrading from
release 3.0 to 3.1.

Fixed a problem that started with PHP 4.3.2 where large image files
would crash with an out-of-memory error. Resolved by adding a line
of code to web/classes/siteframe.php that set the PHP memory
allocation limit to 32M whenever it was processing an image file.

Corrected a bug in the user_ratings content template that caused
to spuriously show an incorrect rating for a document.

Modified the default navigation menu to include folders and categories
whenever they are defined.

Changed admin/chart_days.ihtml to use the property {site_path}.

Implemented plugins/folder_image.php. This plugin allows the site
administrator to (a) select a default image to be displayed for a
folder, and (b) to optionally choose an image from the folder to
be used as the folder's image. It does *not* modify any of the
standard templates (in which the folder's icon is hard-coded); that
must be done separately. This just provides a mechanism for doing
so.

Implemented Subscriptions and associated notifications (messages).

Global property SELF_RATING_ALLOWED; if set, will allow members to
rate their own documents. Default is to NOT allow self-rating.

A new script, contact.php, has been provided to allow site visitors
(not logged in) to contact the site administrators. This page allows
anyone to send e-mail to $SITE_EMAIL. Note that there are no links
provided by default to this script; if you want to use it, you'll
need to add something like this:

  <a href="contact.php">Contact Us!</a>

to one of your templates.

Rewrote the comment class, comment.php, and rate.php, to consolidate
the comment and rating mechanism and to clean up some anomolies.
Modified the ratingbox macro to use the new rate.php page correctly.

Created plugins/restricted.php. This plugin defines a macro,
{!restricted 'group'!} which, when used on a page, will only permit
members of the designated group to view it (administrators can also
view it).

Created an initial online help system, mainly intended to provide
context-sensitive help on form entry fields. This will be expanded
as time and energy permits.

Modified the template import function so that a) if the template
body is unmodified, it does not import it, and b) if it imports and
existing template, it renames it to template.BAK.

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.0.2 - June 11, 2003
======================================================================
Modified classes/vfolder.php to correct a problem where a virtual
folder, when deleted, would delete all the documents in it. It ain't
supposed to do that.

Modified import_templates.php so that it will not run if there are
already templates in the database. This is to prevent inadvertently
(or maliciously) running the script a second time after the templates
have already been loaded.

Corrected a number of problems detected when register_globals=Off.
You should probably leave register_globals=On for the time being.

Modified edit.php and editfolder.php so that they do not lose entered
data in case of an error.

Updated some content templates (mainly "index") to support previously
unsupported features. Templates are now stored in templates.sql,
with prior versions as "templates301.sql," for example. New template
sets are stored in templates/templates.xml for later importing, if
necesssary.

======================================================================
RELEASE 3.0.1 - June 10, 2003
======================================================================
Release 3.0 of Siteframe contains substantial modifications and
enhancements throughout the code. All templates are now stored in
database tables, for example, and there are numerous other
modifications.

Added session reports to the Control Panel (visits per day in both
report and graphic chart format).

(beta 2) modified templates to add a "Type ID" field that identifies
the template as Generic, Home Page, Navigation, or Footer.

Two new autoblocks to support weblogs:
  doc_days - iterates over the last N days that have documents
    creates the single variable {day}
  day_docs - iterates over all the documents for a given day.
You'll use them like this:
  {BEGIN:doc_days 14}
  <p class="date">{!date '{site_date_format}' '{day}'!}</p>
      {BEGIN:day_docs day}
      ... put document stuff here ...
      {END:day_docs}
  {END:doc_days}

Eliminated the global property USE_GD18 - it now automatically
detects whether or not GD2.0 is available; if so, it uses it.

Modified daily.php so that it cannot be run from a browser (either
accidentally or on purpose). Made other modifications just so it's
cleaner for users to understand. Now, daily.php performs most of
the daily functions necessary.

Cleaned up the global properties settings. Now, all global properties
are defined in admin/global_defs.php in a simple structure that can
be appended to by plugins. Modified the Trackback plugin so that
it can be turned on or off by a global property.

New global property DOC_REQUIRE_FOLDER which, if set, requires that
all documents be assigned to a folder.

New global property DOC_REQUIRE_CATEGORY which, if set, requires
that all documents have at least one assigned category.

Modified all the web/ scripts so that they use $_GET and $_POST
instead of relying upon global variables. This means that Siteframe,
at long last, should be able to run on a site where the PHP setting
register_globals=Off. This should provide a much greater degree of
security for the entire website.

A number of scripts that are intended to run as batch files from
the command line (daily.php is the primary one of these, as noted
above) have been modified so that they will fail with an error if
they are invoked from a browser.

Added another template type "Macro" and a new global property
MACRO_AUTOLOAD which, if set, should contain the name of a template
to be automatically parsed for macros. So macros can be set by
either creating them online in this template, or by loading them
from files. The standard macro library is being moved from a file
to a template for this release.

Changed the default "index" template to use a common weblog format
instead of the "corporate" tabular format in prior releases. I hope
to release a number of alternative front-page templates in coming
releases.

New global property MAINT_MODE_MSG, which allows the administrator
to customize the "maintenance mode" message.
