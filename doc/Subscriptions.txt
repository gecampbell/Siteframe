Subscriptions

In Siteframe, a ''subscription'' is a request from a user to be notified of activity involving a document, folder, or group. There are two types of notifications that can be requested:

;add:the user is notified when something is added to the object. For example, the user is notified when a comment is added to a document, a document is added to a folder, or a user is added to a group.
;modify:the user is notified when the requested object is modified. For example, the user would be notified when a document is edited and saved, or when the definition or a folder or group changes.

These are two distinct types of notifications; a user can request either or both of them, but must request at least one (otherwise, there is no activity to subscribe to).

!!! Notification types

Users can request to be notified via e-mail or through an online notification (a popup window that appears the next time the user visits the site). For e-mail notifications, the user can choose to be notified immediately, hourly, daily, or weekly. If immediately, then the user will receive an individual e-mail for each notification. For hourly, daily, or weekly notifications, the user will receive a single e-mail containing all notifications from the preceding time period.

!!! Administrative settings
There are two global properties that control subscriptions. SUBSCRIPTION_ENABLE, if true, allows subscriptions to take place; otherwise, they are not permitted. SUBSCRIPTION_IMMEDIATE, if true, allows immediate notifications to be performed; since immediate notifications can negatively impact the website's performance, this allows them to be turned off.
