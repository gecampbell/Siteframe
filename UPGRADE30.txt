Instructions for upgrading a older version of Siteframe to release 3.0.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:

1. Make a backup of your Siteframe database:
    mysqldump databasename > savedfile

You may be able to do this through a web interface.

2. Make a backup of your Siteframe web directory

DATABASE UPGRADE:

Use the appropriate SQL file to upgrade your database. For example,
if you are currently running Siteframe 2.4.2, use the upgrade240to300.sql
file to upgrade your database. From the command line:

    mysql -f databasename < upgrade240to300.sql

IMPORT TEMPLATES:

You have the option of either installing the supplied release 3.0
templates, or importing your existing templates (if you have made
modifications). To use the Siteframe 3.0 templates, use the
templates.sql file:

    mysql -f databasename < templates.sql

If you want to use your existing templates, then use the
import_templates.php script. This can be run either from a browser
window or from the command line. From a browser window, point your
browser to:

    http://yoursitename/path/import_templates.php

If you are running from the command line:

    php import_templates.php

FINISHING UP:

In Siteframe 3.0, the Home Page, Navigation, and Footer areas are
stored in templates in the database rather than in files. If you
have customized your home page, navigation pane, or page footer,
you may need to create new content templates to hold the existing
values.

1. To create a content template, go to your site's Control Panel:

    http://yoursitename/path/admin/

2. Select "Maintain Content Templates".

3. Select "Create a new template". Make sure that you choose the
proper TYPE of template (Home, Footer, Navigation).

4. Return to the Control Panel menu and

5. Select "Extended Properties"

6. Scroll down to Templates, and select your new templates for the
HOME_PAGE, FOOTER_TEXT, and NAVIGATION properties.

AT LAST:

Since you no longer need the import_templates.php script, you
should delete it so that it cannot be inadvertently executed
again.
